            <br><p>Devi Saroja fondly called as 'Devi Amma' by everyone was born in a pious and religious family in Thiruvananthapuram in 1939.  She was the youngest in the family with two elder sisters - Devi Ponnamma and Devi Manthangi (aka. Thangamma)  and an elder brother Padmanabhan.
                <br><br>Devi Ponamma shouldered the family responsibility from a very young age after the loss of their mother.  She and the younger siblings came to Madras in search of a future which the Jaganmata bestowed on them with all her grace.
                <br> <br>Devi Ponnamma was a very talented person who could sing, write songs, compose music and play the harmonium.  She sang in All India Radio (AIR).  She accompanied Muruga and Devi Amma in all the concerts later.  She reached the divine abode in 1996.
                <br><br>Devi Mathangi (Thangamma) and Devi Saroja learnt Bharathanatyam and have worked in old Tamil films with Travancore sisters - Lalitha, Padmini & Raagini.  Lord Ganesha is her favorite deity.  She accompanied Muruga and Devi Amma after Devi Ponnamma in their concerts.
                <br><br>Padmanabhan worked in JIPMER, Pondicherry and is well versed in astrology.  He is also an ardent devotee of Jaganmata.
                
                <br><br>Devi Amma from a very young age made up her mind to marry someone clad in orange robes.  She had the clairvoyance to tell about her future.  She herself was a staunch devotee of the Jaganmata and she married Sri Muruga in 1978 with the intention of serving him, which she did with utmost care and sincerity.
               <br><br>She reached the divine abode in 2011 after a liver damage, which she told her siblings that if something ails her liver, that would be her ticket to heaven.  She was such a dynamic, resourceful and cheerful person who could sing, play percussion instruments primarily mrudangam, tape, and keep different beat in each hand.  Even today after a couple of years it is still very hard to believe that she is no more midst us. 
                <br><br>She has written many songs including 'Chendur Muruganin Kaladil', 'Kodhichu Kodhichu', 'Bhoota Natha Sadananda', 'Mazhai Pozhiyanum', and many, many more.  In a village where Muruga & Devi Amma went for a bhajan, she sang 'Mazhai Pozhiyanum' and it rained so heavily, that the villagers were so happy and thankful.
                <br><br>Today, Sri Padmanabhan and Sri Devi Thangamma take care of Muruga in 'Sri Devi Nilayam'.</p>
